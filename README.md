# Blog repository on Machine Learning & Deep Learning Concepts
A repository of Python notebooks that illustrates various machine learning and deep learning concepts, such as comparing different types of optimizers, as featured in my Medium blog posts.

## Description
This repository complements my Medium blog, where I delve into various topics in machine learning and deep learning. Each notebook here corresponds to a specific blog post and provides a detailed implementation for the concepts discussed.

The code is implemented using Python and extensively uses libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
